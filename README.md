[*SparkFun Qwiic MultiStar (KIT-21224)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/21224)

Qwiic is a very efficient way to quickly prototype an idea but not all Qwiic-enabled devices have two ports. The SparkFun Qwiic MultiStar (basically the Qwiic MultiPort with special graphics in the shape of a ninja star for a promo-only board release) adds additional ports to boards that have only one Qwiic port on the I2C bus. Once added, you can use it as a hub to add as many I2C devices to the bus as you need! Included are mounting holes so that the board can be secured to any system.
